Description: This package is intended to avoid terrible attempts at 
    pseudo-Swedish/Scandinavian product names. It supplies you with 
    some 12,000 fake products – all based on actual Swedish words 
    and place names (as they should) with "translations" in a few 
    other languages. You can also generate your own "IKEA name".
