# FAKEA /fejka/
Create fake furniture product names

To avoid terrible attempts at pseudo-Swedish/Scandinavian product names, here's a package that supplies you with some 12,000 fake products -- all based on actual Swedish words and place names (as they should).

## Product label (plain)

```
get_type() %>%
  make_tag(logo=2, currency = "$")
```

## Product label (with logo)

```
get_type() %>%
  make_tag(logo=2, currency = "£")
```
