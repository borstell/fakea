# FAKEA /fejka/
Create fake furniture product names

To avoid terrible attempts at pseudo-Swedish/Scandinavian product names, here's a package that supplies you with some 12,000 fake products – all based on actual Swedish words and place names (as they should).

## Installation
```
devtools::install_github("borstell/fakea")
```


## Product label (plain)

```
get_cat() %>%
  make_tag(logo=2, currency = "$")
```

## Product label (with logo)

```
get_type() %>%
  make_tag(logo=2, currency = "£")
```

# The "IKEA name" function
I've seen the _Your IKEA name is your name backwards with an umlaut on the first vowel_. I don't think this is super accurate as the only Swedish "umlauts" are _ä_ and _ö_ (and _å_ if you count [the more uniquely Swedish letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Å)), and _ë_, _ï_ and _ü_ are only used marginally, exclusively in loanwords. The function `makea()` will use the original idea if `original=TRUE`, but in the default `original=FALSE` it will substitute instances of _a_ and _o_ to _å_ or _ä_ and _ö_, respectively. If the additional argument `swedeness` is set to `1` or `2` (default is `0`), a few minor corrections for di- and trigraphs in Swedish orthography are made.

```
> makea("Orbacka")
[1] "Äkcabro"
> makea("Orbacka", original=T, swedeness = 1)
[1] "Äckabro"
> makea("Orbacka", original=F, swedeness = 1)
[1] "Åckabro"
> makea("Orbacka", original=T, swedeness = 2)
[1] "Äckabro"
> makea("Chewbacca", original = F, swedeness = 2)
[1] "Åckåbvutj"
> makea("Schokoladechance", original=F, swedeness = 1)
[1] "Eknåchedålokosch"
> makea("Schokoladechance", original=F, swedeness = 2)
[1] "Eknåtjedalokosj"
```

Using `makea(original=TRUE)` (note the un-Swedish characters _ü_ and _ë_):
